# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Milestone 1: Set up the environment

### Task 1: Set up GitHub
- Set up GitHub and added AiCore's hangman repo in order to practice version control via Visual Studio Code, as per following milestones.

## Milestone 2: Create the variables for the game

### Task 1: Define the list of possible words
- Cloned repo locally and created and navigated to 'add_milestone2' branch.
- Created milestone_2.py locally, which prints a list of my favourite fruits.
- Pushed file but pull request failed checks as had to implement further elements, as per subsequent tasks.

### Task 2: Choose a random word from the list
- Updated milestone_2.py locally so fruit was randomly selected and printed from the list using the 'choice' method from the 'random' module.
- Pushed file update but pull request again failed checks as further functionalities required.

### Task 3: Ask the user for an input
- Updated milestone_2.py with user input functionality to capture a user's guess as a single letter of the alphabet.
- Pushed file update but pull request again failed checks as further functionalities required.

### Task 4: Check the input is a single character
- Updated milestone_2.py with `if-else` validation of user input, which was conditional on both a single letter being entered and the input being a member of the alphabet, as per the `.isalpha()` method.
- Pushed updated file and successfully executed pull request merging it with main and deleting the add_milestone2 branch.

### Task 5: Start documenting your experience
- Updated this README with breakdown of steps taken thus far.
